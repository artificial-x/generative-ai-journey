🌐 What is LangChain?

LangChain is an open-source framework (built with Python and JavaScript) that helps developers build apps powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT.

Think of it like this:
👉 GPT (like ChatGPT) = the brain
👉 LangChain = the toolbox that connects this brain to the outside world (databases, APIs, files, chat history, memory, etc.).

🔑 Why do we need LangChain?

LLMs alone can only respond to prompts. But real-world apps need more features:

Remember conversations (memory)

Search through documents or websites (retrieval)

Connect to APIs, databases, and tools

Chain together multiple steps (reasoning workflow)

LangChain makes this easy.

🛠️ What can you build with LangChain?

Some popular use cases:

Chatbots with memory – smarter than plain GPT

Question answering on documents – upload PDFs, and the bot answers from them

AI Agents – GPT that can use tools like Google search, calculators, or databases

Data analysis assistants – GPT that reads CSV/Excel and gives insights

Custom AI apps – like Jarvis-style personal assistants
