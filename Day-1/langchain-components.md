🔹 Main LangChain Components
1. Models

The brains 🧠 of your app.

Can be:

LLMs (text models) → GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA

Chat Models → ChatGPT

Embedding Models → convert text into numbers (for search & similarity)

📌 Example use: Ask GPT-4 to summarize a document.

2. Prompts

How you ask questions to the model.

LangChain gives tools to build prompt templates so you don’t repeat code.

📌 Example:
Instead of hardcoding:

"Summarize this text: <big text here>"


You create a template like:

"Summarize this text: {text}"


and just replace {text} each time.

3. Memory

AI normally forgets past messages.

Memory stores previous interactions so the chatbot remembers.

📌 Example:

Without memory:
You: My name is Saif
Later: What’s my name?
→ Model forgets.

With memory:
→ Model replies: “Your name is Saif.” ✅

4. Indexes (Retrievers / Vector Stores)

Used when you have a lot of documents (PDFs, notes, articles).

Convert them into embeddings (numbers) and store in a vector database like Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate.

Later you can search inside your own data with AI.

📌 Example: Upload your course notes → ask “Explain topic 3 in simple words.”

5. Chains

A chain = multiple steps linked together.

Example chain:

Step 1: Get a question from user

Step 2: Search documents

Step 3: Summarize answer

Step 4: Return response

📌 Think: Pipeline of tasks → each step feeds the next.

6. Agents

Agents = “smart decision makers.”

Instead of fixed steps, the agent decides what to do next.

Can use tools (like search engine, calculator, database).

📌 Example:
You: “What’s 27 * (the population of Pakistan)?”
→ Agent calls a population API, then a calculator, then replies.

🌍 Real-Life Example

Imagine you build a Research Assistant with LangChain:

Model → GPT-4

Prompt → “Summarize this research paper in 200 words.”

Memory → It remembers your research focus from earlier chats.

Index → Stores all your PDFs so you can query them.

Chain → Ask → Retrieve → Summarize → Answer.

Agent → If it needs more info, it searches online.

👉 That’s the big picture of LangChain Components.
